This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a business using historical customer data. By analyzing patterns and behavior, the model identifies which customers are likely to leave, enabling businesses to take proactive steps to retain high-value customers.

The project demonstrates the end-to-end data analytics workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization. Multiple machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost are applied to achieve accurate predictions.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, categorical encoding, normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing customer behavior, churn distribution, and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to improve model performance.

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost for churn prediction.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights and trends.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit (optional dashboard).

Use Case:

Businesses can identify at-risk customers and implement retention strategies.

Helps improve customer loyalty and revenue by reducing churn.
